Part 1: Foundations. Discover a gentle introduction to natural language processing,
deep learning, and the promise of combining the two, as well as tutorials on how to get
started with Keras.
 Part 2: Data Preparation: Discover tutorials that show how to clean, prepare and
encode text ready for modeling with neural networks.
 Part 3: Bag-of-Words. Discover the bag-of-words model, a staple representation for
machine learning and a good starting point for neural networks for sentiment analysis.
 Part 4: Word Embeddings. Discover a more powerful word representation in word
embeddings, how to develop them as standalone models, and how to learn them as part of
neural network models.
 Part 5: Text Classification. Discover how to leverage word embeddings and convolutional neural networks to learn spatial invariant models of text for sentiment analysis, a
successor to the bag-of-words model.
 Part 6: Language Modeling. Discover how to develop character-based and word-based
language models, a technique that is required as part of any modern text generating model.
 Part 7: Image Captioning. Discover how to combine a pre-trained object recognition
model with a language model to automatically caption images.
 Part 8: Machine Translation. Discover how to combine two language models to
automatically translate text from one language to another.
